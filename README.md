# Final-Project Documentaion 
Book recommendation project

What is our project?

Our project is a book recommender that is meant to recommend 5 books based on user preferences. 
This program takes in user preferences which are the length and rating of a book and their preference of an author 
then the program will give the user a list of five books which align with their preferences. 

How to run the program from the command line?

Step 1)Open terminal and open python 
Step 2)Open the book_reccommender file
Step 3)The first question will ask for you preference in author, enter an author name ex: “ Douglas Adams”
Step 4)The next question will be asking your preferred ratings of books you like from 1-5 ex: 4
Step 5)The last question you will be ask is your preferred length of a book, the program gives you the option of short medium or long books ex: medium 
Step 6)Lastly you will receive a list with 5 books which align with your preferences
ex: The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide: Five Complete Novels and One Story (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  #1-5)
The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  #1-5)
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  #1)
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  #1)
The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  #1-5)
 
How to use the program?
The program will give you five recommendations on books you should read once you input your preferences based on the question asked through the terminal.
Whenever a user finishes a book and is looking for something else to read but is unsure of what book, this program will give a user 5 suggestions based on 
what they like. Once a user has gotten the 5 suggestion this has narrow the list on book they should read
